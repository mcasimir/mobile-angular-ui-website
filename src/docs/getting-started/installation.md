<link rel="stylesheet" href="mobile-angular-ui/dist/css/mobile-angular-ui-base.min.css" />

`mobile-angular-ui-base.css` includes only the mobile css part, it has no media queries except for `col-sm-*` grid. It is intended to target phones and tablets.

`mobile-angular-ui-desktop.css` contains `col-md-*`/`col-lg-*` grid along with some pieces of bootstrap.css for components that are only meaningful on large screens (breadcrumbs, pagination..) and a few lines of code to make sidebars always visible.

No other responsive stuffs are included from `bootstrap.css`.
