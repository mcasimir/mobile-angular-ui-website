###Â Installation

Either install via `bower` or download it

``` sh
bower install --save mobile-angular-ui
```

#### Using the boilerplate

If you want to have your Mobile Angular UI project bootstrapped in a minute you can use the `generator-mobileangularui` generator for Yeoman.

``` sh
npm install -g bower yo gulp generator-mobileangularui
```

Using the generator is super-easy and fast

``` sh
mkdir myApp
cd myApp
yo mobileangularui
```
